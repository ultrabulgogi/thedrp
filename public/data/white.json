White Silver Needle Jasmine is soft in its approach, with a natural sweetness and an enduring floral aura. It embodies the perfect balance between elegant fragrance and a lush finish. To produce this tea, carefully handpicked downy white silver needle tea buds are repeatedly layered with summer jasmine blossoms. The resulting infusion produces an intoxicating, calming tea liquor. Silver Needle Jasmine may be enjoyed either hot or cold-brewed.",

    "description": "These sought-after organic white tea buds are cultivated in the Fujian Province, near Wuyi Mountain, then hand-picked at the 1st Spring harvest of the year. Also known as Baihao Yinzhen, the silver needles name comes from the tiny silver hairs that coat the young tea leaves. The white tea buds steep into a light gold infusion, with naturally light floral notes of honeysuckle with a round body and clean aftertaste. The L-theanine in white tea encourages an alert state of relaxation. This is a tea to be sipped and savored, and a must-try for tea connoisseurs.",

    "description": "Our Snowflakes is a pure, single-estate white tea grown at high elevation by Buddhist monks on Drum Mountain. White teas have the highest antioxidant count of all teas because they are the least processed, and contain the lowest amount of caffeine. It is therefore the perfect meditative aid: it acts as a mild stimulant without causing insomnia or nervousness, working simultaneously to refresh and quiet the mind. Our sublime white tips have a soft, white downy coating and a clean, subtle, very refreshing taste with overtones of chestnuts. This tea brews into a light, yellow liquor and has the delicate aroma of fresh Spring flora.",
